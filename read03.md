## Mustache.js with Node and Express
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.

#### Flexbox
Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element
The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.


The align-content property is used to align the flex lines. The direct child elements of a flex container automatically becomes flexible (flex) items. The align-self property specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container. The align-self property overrides the default alignment set by the container’s align-items property.
