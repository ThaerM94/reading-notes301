 ## After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.


We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,” Dubey said in an interview with The New York Times.

Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

Psychological safety:
Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time. Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
Meaning : Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.


Not all researchers agree While Google’s findings may be true to some extent, a large number of scientific studies have caused researchers (outside of Google’s lab) to shockingly disagree. They claim the exact opposite — that personality, not just skills, is indeed a significant factor in what makes a team successful.

Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at Columbia University and author of the book “Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders? (and How to Fix It),” and psychologist Dave Winsborough, former VP at Hogan Assessment Systems, argue personality, in particular, heavily affects the role of an individual within a team.

Equality in conversational-turn taking, or when everyone speaks roughly the same amount during a meeting; and
Ostentatious listening, or when members of a team demonstrate they are actively listening by repeating what has just been said and making eye contact.

SPEAK HUMAN TO HUMAN Many teams experience a “who did what” confrontation. Fundamental to this type of conflict is recognizing universal needs such as respecting competence, social status and autonomy. Santagata says recognizing these deeper needs naturally elicited trust and promoted positive language and behaviors. Santagata has led his own team through a “Just Like Me” reflection that asked them to consider:

This person has beliefs, perspectives, and opinions, just like me.
This person has hopes, anxieties, and vulnerabilities, just like me.
This person has friends, family, and perhaps children who love them, just like me.
This person wants to feel respected, appreciated, and competent, just like me.
This person wishes for peace, joy, and happiness, just like me.
