#### Database Normalization

`<Database normalization>` is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
The  idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

** General normalization objectives include:
* Minimize the need for restructuring a database when new data types are introduced.
* Make relations free from unwanted deletions, updates, and insertions.
* There are three main reasons to normalize a database.
* The first is to minimize duplicate data.
* The second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues.
* The third is to simplify queries.
## Normal Forms
* When rules of functional dependencies are applied to relations, these relations 
are then transformed into a state that is known as Normal Form.

`<Normalization>` checks that different kinds of inconsistencies are not introduced in the database. 

* Different kinds of normal forms that are used in the relational database
## Management system (RDBMS) are:
1.First Normal form(1NF) 
2.Second Normal form(2NF) 
3.Third Normal form(3NF) 
4.Boyce/Codd Normal form(BCNF)
